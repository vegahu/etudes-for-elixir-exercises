Ã‰tude 4-3: Non-Tail Recursive Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create a module named +Powers+ (no relation to Francis Gary Powers), and
write a function named +raise/2+ which takes parameters +x+  and +n+ and
returns the value of _x_^_n_^.

Here's the information you need to know to write the function:

* Any number to the power 0 equals 1.
* Any number to the power 1 is that number itself -- that stops the
  recursion.
* When +n+ is positive, +x^n^+ is equal to +x+ times +x^(n - 1)^+ --
  there's your recursion.
* When +n+ is negative, +x^n^+ is equal to +1.0 / x^-n^+

Note that this algorithm is _not_ tail recursive.
